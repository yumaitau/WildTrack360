   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure your jurisdiction and organization:**
   ```bash
   # Jurisdiction (ACT, NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, NT)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_JURISDICTION=ACT
   
   # Organization details
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_NAME=ACT Wildlife
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_CONTACT=contact@actwildlife.org.au
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_LOGO=/act-logo.png
   ```

### Supported Jurisdictions

Each jurisdiction has different compliance requirements:

- **ACT**: Full compliance toolkit (all forms enabled)
- **NSW**: Basic compliance (release checklist, incident log)
